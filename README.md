## MANAS Lab

Welcome to MANAS (Models, Algos, Neuroscience, Affect, Psychiatry) Lab. Our research interests are broadly
- To use computational models and tools to understand brain function and behavior, particularly in mood and anxiety disorders.
- To use these insights, to design better experiments and treatments, and thus complete the loop.

** Ryan Thomas Philips (PI) **
I am an Assitant Professor at the School of Arts and Sciences, Azim Premji University (APU). I am a computational neuroscientist by training. I am interested in designing theoretical-model-inspired experiments that probe brain function, particularly in mood and anxiety disorders. I completed my doctoral studies at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), with Prof. V. Srinivasa Chakravarthy as my thesis guide. My postdoctoral training was at the Section on Neurobiology of Fear & Anxiety, at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH/NIH) with Dr. Christian Grillon & Dr. Monique Ernst as my mentors. My current projects include: exploration-exploitation under anxiety; functional connectivity of BNST & CEA using resting state 7T fMRI; the role of mental fatigue in threat biases; investigating valence and uncertainty circuits using task based fMRI.
